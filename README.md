# pico-wordle

This is a rather old project of mine (from spring/summer-ish 2022 i believe) implementing wordle in pico8.

The goal was for it to run on a 3ds via [fake-08](https://github.com/jtothebell/fake-08) and it does!

The game works, it grabs the word from the old predetermined pre-nyt list and plays it. It doesn't have much of a win/lose screen though. Unfortunately it doesn't fit into the proper pico8 cartridge limit (since there's a lot of 5 letter words!), so it can't be exported for web or `.p8.png`. 

I started working on ways to compress the words, but never quite finished it. Maybe one day I'll come back to it who knows!
